Doppia code version1, modified on Fedora23, by ChrisZZ
===

Doppia source code is [here](https://bitbucket.org/rodrigob/doppia), useful for pedestrian detection research.

For paper `Pedestrian detection at 100 fps`, CVPR 2012, we use Doppia version1.
But the source code is written 4 year ago, and cannot compile successfully now on my Fedora23.

I prefer using package manager to install the libraries and tools needed by Doppia. So I wont manually install libs like boost and protobuf.

So I modified some lines of the code and hope can use it on my Fedora23, instead of install an old Operating System and many old version tools & libraries.

Details about how I modified Doppia code, see `modify-detail.md`
